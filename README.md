The "Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes: MultiCloud Deployment and Migration Project" is a complex and practical initiative showcasing advanced skills in MultiCloud infrastructure management, application migration, and database deployment across Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This project leverages a range of technologies, including Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services from both AWS and GCP.

Project Goal and Accomplishments (Missions 1 to 3):
The overarching goal of the project is to demonstrate expertise in MultiCloud architecture, database migration, and application deployment. Here's what was accomplished in Missions 1 to 3:

[Mission 1 (MultiCloud Infrastructure Setup)]: Mission 1 laid the foundation for MultiCloud deployment. It involved setting up AWS and GCP environments, configuring access, enabling essential APIs, and defining cloud resources using Terraform.

[Mission 2 Database and Application Configuration]: In Mission 2, the project focused on database configuration and application setup. Secure database access was established on Google Cloud SQL, and the application was containerized, deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and configured for MultiCloud operation.

[Mission 3 (Data and Application Migration)]: The final mission of the project emphasized data and application migration. Data from an "on-premises" database was exported and imported into Cloud SQL on GCP. Simultaneously, PDF files used in the application were migrated to an AWS S3 bucket. The result is a fully operational MultiCloud architecture where the application can be accessed and data is seamlessly available.

These missions culminate in a successful MultiCloud deployment, where data and applications have been effectively migrated across AWS and GCP. The project exemplifies skills in managing complex infrastructure and showcases the practical application of cloud technologies in real-world scenarios. It serves as a strong testament to the ability to design, configure, and migrate resources across multiple cloud providers, ensuring scalability, performance, and security throughout the process.
